         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110617:2"/>Challenges, in excepting againſt ſuch of the Panil of Jurors, as he thought fit, to the number of a peremptory Challenge, which is 35; when having made acceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch as any ways appertained to the Lieutenancy, at length a Jury of 12 Men were Sworn, and Charged with the Priſoner, to try the Iſſue between the King and him, in Caſe of his Life and Death. Whereupon Colonel <hi>John Rumſey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> Mr. <hi>Keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bourn,</hi> and others, Swore him to be preſent at divers Conſpiracies, Conſults, and Trayterous Contrivances, and that he was to Command a Party, to deſtroy the Guards, whilſt others of his Accomplices, Aſſaſſinated the KING and Duke of of <hi>York,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>February</hi> laſt, at what time they were to return from <hi>New-Market,</hi> and that a Conſult was held to inquire into the day of their return, and that they differed about the particular time, though they afterwards came to a Reſult, but were fruſtrated in their Bloody Deſign, by the Fire that happened at the place aforeſaid. Theſe and ſuch like Contrivances and Conſpiracies Sworn againſt <hi>Walcot</hi> and <hi>Wil. Hone,</hi> on <hi>Fryday</hi> following being the 13th. Inſtant, together with <hi>John Rouſe,</hi> were Tryed for the like Treaſon, in Conſpiring againſt the Life of His Majeſty, Him to Death and final De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to put, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> againſt whom the Kings Evidence depoſed, Firſt, that <hi>Hone</hi> had conſented to be one of the intended Aſſaſſinates, and was to have a Sum of Money to buy him Furniture, as Horſe and Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he declared he was to be one that was to ſeize the Captain and Lieutenant; and at another time, That it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be well with <hi>England</hi> till the <hi>Black-Bird</hi> and <hi>Gold-finch</hi> were knocked on the head, and that he by thoſe Myſterious Expreſſions meant the King and Duke of <hi>York,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Explanation.

               </gap>d; foraſmuch as all hopes of Pardon was vaniſhed; and whether a Reprieve for longer life would be granted to them, remained doubtful, the former and the latter remaining at the pleaſure of His Majeſty, whom they had ſo highly offended. Whereupon take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cordial advice of thoſe that regarded their happineſs (as to the life to come) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſidered in what ſtate they remained, and what a large account they were ſhortly to give before the dreadful Tribunal of all their actions; inſomuch that at times that they were not moleſted with Viſitants, their ſerious thoughts were for the moſt part imployed in confeſſing their ſins, and begging pardon of God for their offences: during their abode in <hi>Newgate,</hi> the Sherriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex</hi> came to Viſit them, and to perſwade them to confeſs the truth of the Conſpiracy as far as their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge would permit, as likewiſe divers other loyal perſons; but they ſeemed much reſerved, ſaying, That they had been drawn into diſgrace, and conſequently to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely end by giving too much credit to the words of ſome perſons; and that it was now too late to retrieve what was paſt, but earneſtly begged pardon of thoſe they had oftended: Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> ſeldom appeared publickly, but kept himſelf to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, either Reading or Converſing with ſuch Friends as came to viſit him. <hi>John Rouſe</hi> was often obſerved in buſie, as is ſuppoſed Writing, but to what Effect remains yet uncertain, unleſs a Petition to humbly beſeech his Majeſty; that his dead Body might be reſtored to his Wife. <hi>William Hone</hi> was the moſt dejected, the fear of death, having almoſt ſtupified him; ſo that he was hardly induced to anſwer to the Queſtions demanded of him, by ſuch as came to Examine him. This and ſuch like being their Behaviour, till they had notice that the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Warrant was Signed for their Execution, and that they muſt prepare to dye as this day, which heavy News they received with different paſſions, and continued as Men who expected no other than death, till the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110617:2"/>morning, at which time being put into Sledges, they were drawn to the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, attended by a ſtrong Guard of the Sheriffs Men, Hamlets, and Warders. About 10 in the Morning, <hi>Thomas Walcot, John Rouſe,</hi> and <hi>Willam Hone,</hi> were brought to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> the former in a Sledge by himſelf and the 2 latter in another Sledge, when being unbound, they were helped into the Cart prepared for that purpoſe, and there for a while converſed with the Miniſters, who were Dr. <hi>Cartwrite</hi> and Mr. Ordinary, both of them perſwading them to make an Ingenious Confeſſion according to the beſt of their knowledge: whereupon Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> drew out two Papers and ſhewed them to the Miniſters and thoſe that were in the Cart, ſaying, That he had written them to Read publiquely, which when he was ordered to do, he, with a compoſed Countenance did Audibly; the firſt was in nature of a Confeſſion of his Enormities to God, wherein he deſired forgiveneſs of his Sins; declaring, that he been a great Sinner; and for that cauſe God had ſuffered him to fall into thoſe Crimes that had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him worthy of death; deſiring God of his mercy to forgive him his manifold offences; and that all the world would forgive him whom he had offended, putting up divers Ejaculations, deſiring that he might be an Example to warn others from daring to attempt any Treaſonable Deſign or Conſpiracy againſt the Life of the King: After which, another Paper he held in his hand, ſometimes looking on it, and other times not, whilſt he was ſpeaking or making his Confeſſion to the people, declaring that he was Guilty of the Conſpiracy as to the knowledge thereof, and that he was drawn into the Conſpiracy by people that promiſed him great things, but that now he plainly perceived there was no Faith in Man: As to the matter of the Aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he confeſſed to have knowledge of it, and that he had been incited thereto by Evil-affected Perſons, whom he deſired God to forgive, praying that his and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows preſent, might be the laſt Blood that might be ſhed upon the Occaſion of the Conſpiracy: He confeſſed he had been at divers Conſults, and that once and no more, to his remembrance, he had been in the company of two Lords, naming divers of the Perſons fled upon the Diſcovery of the Plot and Conſpiracy, ſaying, <hi>They had drawn him unexpectedly into the miſchief, he having not long been arrived in</hi> England, <hi>and that too late he was Conſcious of his too much Credulity, which had brought him to his deſerved, though ſhameful and unexpected end; deſiring God to proſper and preſerve the King, or to this purpoſe.</hi> He alſo ſaid, <hi>That when the Conſpiracy was diſcovered, he was promiſed by ſome, who had drawn him into it, to be ſafely conveyed into</hi> Holland; <hi>and that when they had taken him, and were conveying him to Priſonward, they told him they deſigned to Ship him,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo continued with Penitential Tears, to bewail his Crimes, and unhappy end; but would not own that he was actually to kill the King; though he was to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting therein; deſiring the people to obey and in all Cordial ſincerity in dear themſelves to His Majeſty, who well deſerved the love and tendereſt reſpect of his Subjects. This being the ſubſtance of <hi>Walcots</hi> Speech, <hi>John Rouſe</hi> began to make his Confeſſion, when having deſired God to forgive him his Sins, he confeſſed that he had been at divers Conſults, and that he was to have acted, but as to each particular he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; but that he had been privy to many Treaſonable Diſcoveries, tending to an Inſurrection or the like, deſiring God to forgive him his many Sins, which he ſaid had been multiplyed; but that he was above all, ſorrowful for offending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch great Light, ſaying, The crys of a Wife and Children were the chiefeſt Inſtigations to make him ingage in the Wicked Deſign, of which he heartily repented, and for which he had juſtly deſerved to dye; declaring that he had been drawn into it by the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and others who were now fled; and that he did not, when firſt he entred into it, think the Deſign had any ways tended to the touching the Life of His Majeſty, or that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy would have arrived to the heigth it at laſt did; and continued to expreſs his ſorrow and Repentance for his being ſo long Conſcious of ſo Notorious a Wickedneſs, and not revealing it; which he Attributed to the fear of his own ſafety, by reaſon he had for ſome time paſt, been under evil Circumſtances, and been rendred Obnoxious to many perſons of known Loyalty. And in fine, he confeſſed moſt of the Charge, Evidenced againſt him at his Tryal in the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> on the 13th. Inſtant, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110617:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>complaining againſt thoſe that had drawn him into the miſchievous Conſpiracy, begging forgiveneſs of all he offended in thought or deed, deſiring God to continue the King's Life, and long Reign, <hi>&amp;c. Hone</hi> ſpoke little as to particulars, but in general, confeſſed that he was guilty of the Conſpiracy, and was to have been one of the number, that was to have Aſſaſſinated the King, in his return from <hi>New-Market;</hi> and that <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough</hi> and others, had by many perſwaſions prevailed with him, to undertake what he did. He likewiſe confeſſed, he had told Mr. <hi>Weſt,</hi> he had ſpoke with <hi>Goodenough,</hi> and related to him the meaſures that he was to take; ſaying, That he had agreed to be one in the Aſſaſſination, with divers other Circumſtances, of which theſe are the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial; though indeed his diſcourſe was but ſhort, in reſpect to the two former.</p>
            <p>The Confeſſions thus made, or as near as could be taken; thus, or to this Effect the Miniſters prayed with them, and ſung a Pſalm, after which, they ſeverally deſired to ſay a Prayer of themſelves, which was granted: Captain <hi>Walcot</hi> being firſt, who prayed fervently, as being throughly ſenſible of his Offence, deſiring the prayers of all good men. Next, <hi>Hone</hi> made a prayer, and afterwards <hi>Rouſe,</hi> each of them ſeeming greatly to bewail the greatneſs of their Offences, asking forgiveneſs, eſpecially of His Majeſty, againſt whom they had ſo highly offended; when being asked what further they had to ſay, they only deſired that God would forgive them, and that all people would take Example by them, and not be inticed, or perſwaded to enterprize ſo great a Wickedneſs, as had brought them to ruin; Temporal though as they hoped God would accept of their late Repentance, and thoſe that heard them, and beheld their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely end, would take warning thereby, and avoid the like Temptations.</p>
            <p>Thus, or to this Effect, they having confeſſed and declared, the Cart was drawn away, and after they had Hung three quarters of an hour, they were cut down, and Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red one by one, their Bowels burnt; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> According to the Sentance pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
